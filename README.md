# Portfolio Project
Project using hand written HTML &amp; CSS fundamentals

## Situation & Task
Task was to create a portfolio or persobal profile page, using basic HTML & CSS.

## Approach
I didn't use CSS Grid or Flexbox, which would make creating layouts a lot easier. Instead I had to rely on display modes, namely inline-block to arrange elements like the article cards in a horizontal row, that then stacks vertically on smaller screen sizes.

I've utilised a lot of things learnt during the first week.
Things like:
- Sticky nav positioning (stays at the top when you scroll down)
- CSS transitions & transforms
- Pseudo elements in the use of emoji icons
- CSS Variables to make reusing properties and editing them a lot easier and more organised

## Results
I'm fairly happy with my results.
There does seem to be a weird bug, where hovering over an article card causes it to overlap the sticky nav when you scroll down. Not sure how to resolve this.

There are some quirks with horizontally centering parts of the page that I would like to tweak too, but I know using flexbox would make this a lot easier.
